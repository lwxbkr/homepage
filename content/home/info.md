The golden rules of structural analysis(from [Ze'ev Reches](http://earthquakes.ou.edu/reches/)):

  <font color=DodgerBlue >**First**</font>: identify an unresolved structural problem that deserves your efforts (it is not easy!).  
  <font color=DodgerBlue >**Second**</font>: (the bad news) structures are not as simple as they may look: they are three-dimensional, non-linear and time-dependent.  
  <font color=DodgerBlue >**Third**</font>: (the good news) recognize the critical features and measure them accurately: these observations will provide a key to the solution.  
  <font color=DodgerBlue >**Fourth**</font>: modeling must be linked to the critical observations (no use for theory without data!).
    
Our research interests include  
Deformation processes associated with faults in the upper crust:  
            · Fracturing of reservoir rocks and fault activation/seal  
            · Fault rupturing and fault damage zones  
            · Earthquakes, seismic hazard and landslides
